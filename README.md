# üêç Python Snake Game

A classic implementation of the Snake game built from scratch using Python and the built-in `turtle` module.

This project is written using object-oriented programming (OOP), splitting the game's logic into separate classes for the `Snake`, the `Food`, and the `Scorecard`.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Classic Gameplay:** Control the snake to eat the food and grow longer.
* **OOP Design:** The code is cleanly organized into four classes:
    * `Snake`: Manages the snake's body, movement, and controls.
    * `Food`: Manages the food's appearance and random placement.
    * `Scorecard`: Manages score tracking and displays the "Game Over" message.
    * `main`: Handles the main game loop, screen setup, and collision detection.
* **Collision Detection:** The game ends if the snake hits a wall or its own tail.
* **Responsive Controls:** The controls are designed to prevent the snake from turning 180 degrees back onto itself in a single move.
* **Clean UI:** Features a simple, dark-themed background.

## üíª Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Core Libraries:** `turtle` (for graphics), `random` (for food), `time` (for game speed)

## üöÄ How to Run

There are two ways to play this game:

### 1. For Players (Easy Method)
You can download the ready-to-play game for Windows directly from the releases page.

1.  Go to the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/Spargerx/Snake_Game/releases)**.
2.  Under the latest release, click on `snake_game_v1.0.exe` or `snake_game_v1.0.zip` to download it.
3.  Double-click the downloaded file to play!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Antivirus / Windows Defender Warning

Some users may see a message like "Virus detected" or "Unrecognized app" when downloading the `.exe` file from the Releases page.

**Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî this is a false positive and a common issue with Python games built using PyInstaller.**

### üß† Why this happens

* The game‚Äôs `.exe` file is not digitally signed (it‚Äôs made by an independent developer (me!!), not a verified company).
* Windows Defender and some antivirus tools flag new, unsigned executables as ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù simply because they haven‚Äôt seen them before ‚Äî not because they contain malware.

You can verify the source code here on GitHub ‚Äî it‚Äôs 100% open-source and safe to run.

### ü™Ñ How to safely run the game

If you downloaded the `.exe` and Windows blocks it:

1.  Right-click the file ‚Üí **Properties** ‚Üí check ‚Äú**Unblock**‚Äù (if the option appears).
2.  Double-click to open it.
3.  If you see ‚ÄúWindows protected your PC‚Äù:
    * Click **More info**
    * Then click **Run anyway**

Or, if you prefer, you can always build your own `.exe` directly from the source using:

```sh
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py
```

### 2. For Developers (Running from Source)
If you have Python installed on your computer and want to run the code yourself:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Spargerx/Snake_Game.git](https://github.com/Spargerx/Snake_Game.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Snake_Game
    ```
3.  **Run the game!**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to use `python3 main.py` on macOS or Linux)*
